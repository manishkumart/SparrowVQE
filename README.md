## Week 3-8 Slides Summary
![Week 3 to Week 8 Machine Learning Concepts](/images/example_01.drawio.png)
*This image provides a visual summary of key machine learning concepts covered between weeks 3 to 8. It includes topics such as avoiding overfitting, understanding logistic functions in the context of probabilities, exploring the 'face space' in image recognition, analyzing the curse of dimensionality, PCA as matrix factorization, and Gaussian Mixture Models.*

## Week 10-15 Slides Summary
![Week 10 to Week 15 Machine Learning Concepts](/images/example_02.drawio.png)
*This image provides a visual summary of key machine learning concepts covered between weeks 10 to 15. It illustrates topics such as the differences in model spaces between decision trees and nearest neighbors, understanding margins in SVMs, the role of Vision Transformers and MLP heads in neural networks, the effect of bagging on model variance, and an introduction to entropy in the context of decision trees.*
